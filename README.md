# AR-3d-Model-Spawn-
Developed a Unity application where a 3D character is spawned by scanning a predefined image using image recognition. Implemented C# scripts for image detection, object placement, and tracking. The project improved my understanding of AR concepts, Unity workflows, and real-time 3D rendering.
